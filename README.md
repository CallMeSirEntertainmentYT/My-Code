# My code
**This repository contains all the code I have ever made.**

**There are two ways a coding project will make it's way into the repository: either it will be made directly in this repository or be imported from my private repository, Large-Projects.**

**The Large-Projects repository holds large projects until they are ready to be released to the public.**

**If you would like to make a suggestion for a project, contact me [here](mailto:callmesirentertainment@outlook.com?subject=Coding%20Project%20Suggestion).**
